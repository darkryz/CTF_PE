CTF - Privilege Escalation - Training for users

The following challenges are my personal creations. They are CTFs based on different themes, in this case the elevation of privileges. These CTFs are divided into different levels of difficulty:
1 - easy 
2 - medium
3 - intermediate
4 - difficult
They are designed to be run locally using the "Docker Desktop" application on Windows. The goal is to get the flag in the home directory of the other user. You'll need for that to make a privielge escalation to become this user.

The principle behind the creation of these challenges is my desire to share and raise awareness among business users in a gamified format to make them aware of good practice. 
I may publish my other themes later. Currently in stock : OSINT, password cracking, Web attack.
